        <p align="justify"> Hello! I'm John Riz D. Dancal, you can call me Riz or RJ for short. I'm 14 years old and currently in 9th Grade. I'm studying in Las Piñas City National Science High School. My favorite sport is basketball, though I had to switch to volleyball for some reasons I still wish I could represent my school in the upcoming cluster meet. I like light and dark colors, my favorite number is 7, I love the color blue, my favorite artist is The Weeknd, and many more. If you want to know more about me, just <a href="https://www.facebook.com/johnriz.dancal.10?mibextid=kFxxJD"> message me. </a></p>

        <h3 align="center">Reflection</h3>
<p> First of all, I want to say thank you for everything Mrs. Uminga. Thank you for being there for me and to your students, giving your knowledge to us.May you continue to give your knowledge to others and I know for sure God will give all the blessings you have given to others. <br><br> Honestly, I didn't expect that I would learn this much in ICT, I used to sleep during my ICT class both in Grade 7 and 8 since I'm not really a fan of high-technology things and I would prefer staying in traditional ways. But something changed and I liked ICT now unlike the past years. Probably because I took academics seriously and didn't focus that much in sports. I hope to know more about this subject and may apply it in real life.<br><br>This subject made me realize that I should open my mind in changes, I should accept and adapt to it. I would like to give thanks to God, my family, to my beautiful, lovely, attractive, gorgeous, stunning, charming, cute, fair, appealing, alluring, delightful, elegant, sweet, pleasant, good-looking teacher, Mrs. Mary Grace Uminga, to my classmates, and a special shoutout to my baks, Ate Jenine Agatha Lim from 10-Commitment. Thank you !!</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;font-family:timesnewroman;color:#964B00;"> Reflections </h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;color:#964B00;"> Even though I had a short time in learning and catching up with the given activities for this quarter, I still learned alot. I would like to thank my classmates, specially my brothers in our class for helping me cope up with our lessons. Learning CSS gave me a new opportunity to learn the other side of coding, it helped me alot to make my electronic portfolio even better. I applied the floating images and even used selectors, span and div, typography, and many more for my outputs. Truly CSS has a great power in coding.<br><br>

I would like to extend my gratitude to our teacher, Mrs. Uminga for teaching us. She is a very great teacher, she is always considerate to her students, and gives us a reason to smile in her class. <br><br>

Lastly, I would like to say thank you to my parents, friends, eapecially to Jenine Lik from 10 Commitment and Jhio Marasigan of 10 Imaginative for always being there for me no matter what happens in my life.<br><br>

I would like to leave a quote from the bible “Do to others as you would have them do to you.” — <b>Luke 6:31</b>. </p>
